# OptiX
A Discord bot made with love and bad JS.



## Discord
Check out the [OptiX Discord](https://discord.gg/ydjYVJ2). It'll really help me out.
When there, you can apply to be a contributer.
See instant updates on the bot's code.



## There are more plans with this in the future, such as:
- A database
- Guild settings
- Customizable prefix, logging channel, etc.
- More game stats commands
- Better music system



### Contributers
None yet, go to the Discord to apply.



## Use
If you use this code, I ask of one thing, please credit me. ;3



### Customization
Just open up the `botConfig.json` and edit it.



##### Project Updates
- Will not be able to work on as much, started school back.
